# Group Dynamic XP
## Introduction
The Group Dynamic XP module is tailored for persistent servers with small group dynamics. It enhances the original functionality by providing increased XP rewards when playing in a group, ensuring that players who venture solo don't leave their companions behind. Additionally, the module introduces dynamic XP scaling within groups, allowing adjustments based on the level of the lowest or highest member. This feature enables players to accommodate varying playstyles, whether they prefer to wait for friends to catch up or accelerate their progress.
