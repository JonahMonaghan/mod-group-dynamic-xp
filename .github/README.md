#Group Dynamic XP
## Introduction
This module is designed for persistent servers that have small groups. The modifications made to the original mod give increased XP rewards when playing in a group, so players who login solo don't leave their friends behind.
Additionally, the group's dynamic XP rate can be based on the level of the lowest or highest member. Allowing those who stayed up a few extra hours to grind to wait for their friends to catch up, or to accelerate the process.
